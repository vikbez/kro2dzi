Tool to convert a .KRO file to a DZI (Deep Zoom Image) format (dir + xml)
Usage: ./script [image.kro]

output will be written in image.kro directory

This tool is memory efficient;
it loads chunks of image_x * tile_y; example:
100000x15000 image (4.5go file) tiling at 256px will take approx 100mb ram

DZI Format desc: take a look at http://www.gasi.ch/blog/inside-deep-zoom-2/

Tested functionnal on 64bits win7 with 64bits python 2.7 and 64bits PIL library
needs PIL (python image library)
